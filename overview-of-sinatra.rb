# Overview of Sinatra 

# MVC Structure 

# Models - where data lives, objects/DB are described 

# Controller - goes between Movels & Views 
# Where we define both our routes and our actions
# Routes - the http verb plus the URL = route 
# Action - what happens within a particular route - defined within the block we pass 

# Views - What the user sees and interacts with
